# Assessment for Mid-level R Developer at Actserve.
This repository contains instructions on the assessement that was given for a mid-level R developer at ActServ and my solutions to the tasks.

In summary the assessment consists of two parts; processing data with data.table R package and buidling JSON data APIs with the Ambiorix R package.
